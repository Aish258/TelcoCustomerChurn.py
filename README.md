Telco Customer Churn Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python. The dataset contains customer details, service subscriptions, and churn information. The goal is to explore patterns in customer behavior and identify factors leading to churn.


Dataset

The dataset used is WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv. It includes:

Customer demographics

Service subscription details

Tenure and billing information

Churn status (Yes/No)


Features Implemented

Data Exploration:

Loading and displaying the dataset

Checking for missing and duplicate values

Data cleaning (handling missing values, data type conversions)


Data Visualization:

Pie chart for churn distribution

Bar charts for customer churn by gender, senior citizen status, and contract type

Histograms to explore churn behavior across tenure

Stacked bar charts to compare churn rates across various services

Count plots for different telecom services and their impact on churn



Key Insights

Customers with short tenure (1-2 months) are more likely to churn.

Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates compared to longer-term contracts.

Customers using Electronic Payment methods have a higher likelihood of churning.

Lack of Online Security, Tech Support, or Device Protection increases the chance of churn.



Future Improvements

Implement Machine Learning models to predict churn.

Conduct deeper feature engineering for better insights.

Deploy the model as a web-based dashboard.
